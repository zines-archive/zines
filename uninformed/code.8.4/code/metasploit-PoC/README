This is a PoC for the Apple Atheros vulnerability written in Ruby for the Metasploit
project. It requires a working copy of LORCON, it can also be used with the BackTrack
(http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack.html) Live auditing CD. Drop this script in
<metasploit home>/modules/auxiliary/dos/wireless then run msfconnsole and it should
be available. 

In the PoC the only information needed is the loading address of the AirPortAtheros5424
kext. Since the Kext's often reload at the same address, you should only have to find
this offset once. For instance, the default is set to 0x8e7000, which 99 times out of
100 is hte address the test Macbook will load the driver at. Once you have found the offset
with kextstat, convert it to decimal and use that value to set the KEXT_OFF option.
