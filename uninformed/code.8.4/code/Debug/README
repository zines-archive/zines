These are the debug tools from the madwifi project (http://www.madwifi.org).
The have been modified to work with OSX. To build them it should be as simple
as (sorry, no makefiles yet):
gcc -D__osx__ 80211debug.c -o 80211debug
gcc -D__osx__ athdebug.c -o athdebug

Running them should be as easy as:
./80211debug +scan

They need root privs to set the debug values.
