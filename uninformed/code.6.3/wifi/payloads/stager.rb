	# Returns a kernel-mode stager that transitions from r0 to r3 by placing
	# code in an unused portion of SharedUserData and then pointing the
	# SystemCall attribute to that unused portion.  This has the effect of
	# causing the custom code to be called every time a user-mode process
	# tries to make a system call.  The returned payload also checks to make
	# sure that it's running in the context of lsass before actually running
	# the embedded payload.
